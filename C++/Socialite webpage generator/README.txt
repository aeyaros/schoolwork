Socialite readme file
-----------

This was a simple homework assignment for CS 172 at Drexel where I
created a program in C++ which generates simple "profile pages" for an 
an imagined social network. The program looks at information in a text
file called "Socialite Setup.txt". The data needed for a page is as
follows, with the information for each field taking up a single line
in the file, followed by four "+" characters used as a delimiter:

    The user's username
    The user's first name
    The user's last name
    URL of the user's profile picture
    URL of the user's personal website
    The title/name of the personal website
    The user's current country
    The user's current city
    ++++

As many of these can be in the file as you wish. When the program is run,
formatted HTML and TXT files will be created for each user specified in
the input file. Samples of this can be seen in the "Sample output" folder.
