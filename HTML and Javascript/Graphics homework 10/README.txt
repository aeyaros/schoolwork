The HTML page will display a paragraph explaining the controls for rotating the arm and moving the joints. Joints can be moved using either the keyboard or the sliders on the page. The arm is built from the same cube which gets transformed in various ways for each part. The first joint can be rotated freely. The arm has constraints on it for the second joint, which cannot move into the rest of the arm, and on the third joint so it cannot move up or down too much. I do have the parts overlapping slightly where the joints are because having a bunch of floating parts looks a bit weird.
