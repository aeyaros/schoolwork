						<div class="subhead">Current version: 0.7&beta;</div><br/>
							Fixes:
							<ul>
								<li>Fixed illegal move highlighting.</li>
								<li>Joining a random game now works properly.</li>
								<li>Additional event handlers added for clicking to allow for more responsiveness.</li>
							</ul>
							Known Issues:
							<ul>
								<li>Crowning is fixed, although there is a bug where crowns may change color.</li>
							</ul>
							
						<br/><hr>
						<div class="subhead">0.6&alpha;</div><br/>
							Known issues:
							<ul>
								<li>Server doesn't prevent game from connecting to itself; when starting a random game it immediately connects to itself rather than waiting for another instance of the client to ask for a random game.</li>

								<li>Clients aren't yet prompted to join games; both clients must try to connect with each other. This requires a first client to make an initial request, a second to make a request  (after which the second will enter the game), and another request for the first client to join the already open game.</li>

								<li>Some suggested moves may be incorrectly highlighted. However, they will be rejected by the server if attempted.</li>

								<li>Pieces are not crowned; the server doesn't send back a representation of them as kings; instead it keeps the pawn representations, and prevents them from being moved.</li>
								<li>Sometimes, a user must click twice on the destination square for their current move.</li>
								<li>Sometimes, highlighted moves may be displayed more than once when the user is clicking around, showing a stronger highlight color (i.e. drawing multiple translucent objects on top of each other on the HTML5 canvas)</li>
								<li>Error-flash events (where board briefly flashes light) occurs too often</li>
