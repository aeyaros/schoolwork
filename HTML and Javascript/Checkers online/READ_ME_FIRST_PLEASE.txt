---------------

I did the front end development on this project. Thus, work explicitly done by me can be found in the following places:

	/src/main/resources/public/	(Front end UI files that I created)
	/Prototypes			(some initial HTML I wrote)

Additionally, I contributed to our project documentation in the /Documents directory.

Note: To actually get this to work, you need to run the server my group members wrote. I intend to get that up and running sooner or later as soon as I rent out some space on AWS or somewhere else, but until then I'm showcasing the code I wrote here and providing the server code in case you actually want to build it and test my UI. I doubt you have the time to do this.
