---------------

I did the front end development on this project. Thus, work explicitly done by me can be found in the following places:

	/src/main/resources/public/	(Front end UI files that I created)
	/Prototypes			(some initial HTML I wrote)

Additionally, I contributed to our project documentation in the /Documents directory. A link to an instance of the project running on my AWS account can be found at my homepage at andrewyaros.com. You can open it up in two different browsers (or in a regular window and a private window; as long as the cookies and other data aren't shared between the two windows) and play with yourself. Currently, joining specific games works, but is disabled because it is not handled in a user friendly way.
