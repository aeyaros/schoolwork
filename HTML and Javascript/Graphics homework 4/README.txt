I know you weren't expecting this, but to run this assignment, open hw4.html in your browser.

You may use the menus and the up/down buttons to change which axis you are using, which transformation you are editing, and to adjust the values for that transformation. You can also press keys (as described on the page) to increase and decrease values for the selected transformation for each of the three axes (the selected axis menu will update accordingly).
