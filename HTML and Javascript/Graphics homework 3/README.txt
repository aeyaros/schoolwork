Andrew Yaros - CS 432 - HW 3 - README

The main file for the homework is hw3.html.

Instructions:
Double click hw3.html and follow the instructions on the page. Also feel free to admire the nice CSS styling and beautiful user interface that I didn't have to do but felt like doing anyway.

Information:
Contains the shapes from hw2, but with rotating squares and triangle, breathing circle, ellipse that changes color when keyboard keys are pressed, menu for changing white-square color, button for reversing rotation, slider for rotation and breathing speed control, and click-to-pentagon functionality.
