Part four of the homework assignment may be very simple of very complicated depending upon whether or not you took our advice.
The assignment is to ensure that there is no reference to a test, correct answer or grading in any code the survey sees.
If your code already is written this way, simply submit a sentence to learn stating my survey code contains no references to a test.
If you are wrong and your code does have references, you will lose points for each reference to inappropriate code. 
Your code still code still has to function.
All previous deliverables must be met.
